This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
  		  
This application was built while experimenting with Firebase and React. It allows a user to login (through Google) and vote for a restaurant where they would like to go eat lunch!
  		  
Write "yarn start" in your console to start the dev server. 
  		  
Write "yarn build" to build the app.
